            <h2 class="aboutTitle">What is Destination Creation?</h2>
            <p>Destination Creation is a project organization that helps people to create their own content creations online.  This will allows people to market and make their own videos and web sites.  We can help other people on how to create their own content and how to make it successful.  These includes shopping sites, movie reviews, let's play videos, podcasts and more. In addition, this project will help the Internet run fairly and make it a place to run and work freely.</p>

            <h2 class="aboutTitle">How will Destination Creation change the future?</h2>
            <p>The Internet has been changing throughout the years both good and bad.  We're trying remove some of the bad things that has been happening on the Internet i.e. demonetization, slow lanes or unfair YouTube claims.  And instead replace them with positive ideas that both content creators and the system are treated equally.  We want to welcome new creators and let them spread their creativity.  The Internet is not going anywhere and neither will anyone else.</p>
